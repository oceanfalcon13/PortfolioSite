    <h2>Project 1: Multimodal Presentation on Nuclear Power</h2>
    <p>
        This was a project that I coded myself. It is a small website with five webpages.
        The goal of this project was to inform an audience with information regarding nuclear power.
        I learned the importance of and how to accurately research topics and obtain credible sources.
        This will be useful as it gives me tools to find and ignore misinformation.
